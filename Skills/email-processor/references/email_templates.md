4. **Proofread** - Check for accuracy before sending

**Always require approval for:**
- Financial communications (invoices, payments, quotes over $50)
- New contacts (any topic)
- Sensitive topics or complaints

**Consider auto-approve for:**

- Payment confirmations (after payment verified)

**When in doubt, always require approval.**
