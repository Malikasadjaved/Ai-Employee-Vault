# Needs Action Folder

This folder contains items that require AI analysis and decision-making.

Watcher scripts create files here when they detect important events:
- Urgent emails
- Payment requests
- Client messages
- File uploads requiring processing

The Orchestrator monitors this folder and triggers Claude Code to process items.
