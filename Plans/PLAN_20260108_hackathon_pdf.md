## Document Analysis

**Source:** Personal AI Employee Hackathon PDF  
**Type:** Reference Material / Documentation  
**Priority:** Normal

## Summary

This appears to be documentation about the hackathon itself - the very event you're participating in! This is reference material rather than something requiring action.

## Recommended Actions

1. **File appropriately:**
   - Move to a "Reference" or "Documentation" folder
   - This is learning material, not an actionable task

2. **Extract key information:**
   - Review hackathon requirements
   - Note important deadlines
   - Understand tier requirements

3. **Update Dashboard:**
   - Log as "Reference material processed"
   - No action items generated

## Next Steps

- [ ] Move original file to appropriate reference location
- [ ] Mark this action as complete in /Done folder
- [ ] Update Dashboard.md with processing note

## Processing Notes

This is a meta-document - it's about the system we're building! Good for reference but doesn't require typical document processing workflow.
